# Citi Bike trip Analysis

## Task
Our employer, Citi Bike, tasked our team with building a trip duration prediction tool for the marketing department.

The primary function of this tool is to use inputs such as user gender, age, subscription type and trip start time to predict a total trip time

Our team decided to use pandas to clean the data and matplotlib to visualize it.

We decided to visualize additional data in JavaScript, html/CSS, and tableau.

After attaining a better understanding of all of the data, our team decided to create a linear regression machine learning model to predict trip time

## Languages Used

We used Jupyter Notebook to read in the libraries, consisting of SciKit and TensorFlow, Pandas and matplotlib were used to clean and visualize the data. The website was reated using Javascript, HTML5 and CSS, embedded was a Tableau map of the Citi bike locations.
